# Movie_Recommendation_System
In this project, I developed a movie recommendation system using Python. Users input their favorite movie, and the system suggests similar movies based on their preferences. Leveraging the dib library, the system ands the closest match to the user's input from a list of movie titles. It then calculates a similarity score between the selected movie and all other movies in the dataset using machine learning techniques. The system sorts the movies based on their similarity scores and presents the top recommended movies to the user. This project enhances user engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized movie recommendations tailored to individual preferences.
